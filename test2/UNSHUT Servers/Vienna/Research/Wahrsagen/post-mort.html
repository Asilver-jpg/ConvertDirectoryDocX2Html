<p>10.10.88</p><p>Dear Colleagues,</p><p>I regret to inform you that our study on the effectiveness of divining rods in locating underground resources will no longer be proceeding. Unfortunately, my Junior Agent has committed an ethical breach that has cast doubt on the validity of our findings. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to abandon the study and discontinue all further research in this area.</p><p>This is a deeply disappointing outcome, as we had high hopes for the potential applications of divining rods in the field of resource exploration. However, the integrity of our research is of the utmost importance, and we cannot continue with the study under the circumstances.</p><p>I understand that this news will come as a surprise to many of you, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.</p><p>Thank you for your understanding.</p><p>With regret,</p><p>Ivan Talbot</p>
