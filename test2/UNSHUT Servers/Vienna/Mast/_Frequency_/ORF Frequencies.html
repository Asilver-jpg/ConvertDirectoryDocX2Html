The exact process of licensing FM frequencies in Austria has changed over time, but the following provides a general overview of the process:</p><p>1955-1980: In the early days of FM broadcasting in Austria, ORF would typically negotiate directly with the government for the right to use specific FM frequencies. The government would then issue licenses to ORF for the use of these frequencies, subject to certain conditions and limitations.</p><p>1980-: As the number of FM broadcasters increased in Austria during this time, the process of licensing FM frequencies became more formalized and regulated. The Austrian government established a regulatory body, the Rundfunk und Telekom Regulierungs-GmbH (RTR), which was responsible for overseeing the allocation of FM frequencies in the country. ORF would apply to RTR for licenses to use specific FM frequencies, and RTR would then allocate these frequencies to ORF based on a number of factors, including the coverage area and availability of the frequencies.</p>
