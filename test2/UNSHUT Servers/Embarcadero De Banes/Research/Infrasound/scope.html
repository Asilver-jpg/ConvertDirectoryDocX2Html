<p>Infrasound refers to sound waves with frequencies below the lower limit of human hearing (generally considered to be 20 Hz). </p><p>Although these sounds are not audible to the human ear, they can still have an impact on the environment and on living beings, including causing vibrations and physical discomfort. Infrasound has been studied in a variety of fields, including geophysics, seismology, atmospheric science, and wildlife biology, and is sometimes used for monitoring purposes or for non-lethal crowd control.</p><p>This research will greatly inform our understanding of the simulation.</p>
