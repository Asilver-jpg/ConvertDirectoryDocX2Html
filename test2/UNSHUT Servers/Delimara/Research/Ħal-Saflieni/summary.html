<p>The Hypogeum of Ä¦al-Saflieni is an underground prehistoric burial complex located in the town of Paola, Malta. It was discovered in 1902 and is believed to have been used between 4000 and 2500 BCE during the Tarxien Cemetery period. The complex consists of three levels, with the upper level featuring a number of burial chambers, the middle level being a series of interconnected passageways, and the lower level featuring a large, circular chamber known as the &quot;Oracle Room.&quot; The Hypogeum is unique for its elaborate architecture and rock-cut design, as well as the numerous decorations and carvings found on its walls. It is also notable for its advanced acoustic engineering, with the Oracle Room being designed to amplify sound to create an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere. </p>
